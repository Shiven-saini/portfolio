It adheres to Material 3 design guidelines for a modern and consistent UI, leverages ML Kit for QR code detection, and uses the Accompanist library for efficient permission handling. The app emphasizes reliability, modularity, and reboot resilience, making it a robust and extensible solution for advanced alarm functionality.',

The app features robust authentication and role-based authorization, enabling admins to manage user privileges and assign roles efficiently. It also includes a dynamic event gallery that highlights the societyâ€™s legacy and activities. Developed using native Android technologies such as Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Ktor for networking, the app is currently powered by a Spring Boot backend deployed on AWS EC2. Future plans include exploring migration to Supabase for improved scalability and maintenance. The project reflects a strong emphasis on clean architecture, user-centric design, and backend integration.",
